CHAIT :kite:  (pronounced `kite`): **C**able-suspended **H**ybrid **A**erial **I**nflight-grasping and **T**ransportation

ROS1/Gazebo plugins for cable-suspended collaborative aerial manipulation simulations developed for *Dynamics and
Control for Collaborative Aerial Manipulation* dissertation.

This package is particularly designed for payload grasping using cable-suspended grippers and cable-suspended payload
transportation using quadrotor(s).
For vision/learning supported quadrotor simulators see the links listed below.
