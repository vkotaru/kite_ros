ROS1/Gazebo plugins for cable-suspended collaborative aerial manipulation simulations developed for *Dynamics and
Control for Collaborative Aerial Manipulation* dissertation.

This package is particularly designed for payload grasping using cable-suspended grippers and cable-suspended payload
transportation using quadrotor(s).
For vision/learning-supported quadrotor, simulators see the links listed below.
